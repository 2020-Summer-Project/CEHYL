# Team CEHYL

### Scope of Problem

1. Most of the news platforms focus on COVID-19 related news and this might undermine the communication of the seriousness of some other disease outbreaks in Singapore that may be on the rise such as dengue fever.
1. The pressing need to keep track of oneâ€™s temperature and health status/records.
1. To be updated with the latest medical statistics of Singapore for a healthier nation.
1. Interested in the health tips and diet of others.

## Description

Our application, _Track My Health_, serves to allow users to view all medical statistics of local disease outbreaks in Singapore as well as to be a mini health journal for users to keep track of their personal health statistics such as temperature, any medical records and a forum to share their views.

Our application uses React Native, Node.js, Firebase Realtime Database.

## Running the Application (APK)

1. Install the relevant APK (iOS or Android) on either an emulator or a physical device.

## For developers: starting the app for testing

1. Ensure that you have the latest version of NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/
1. Launch a terminal such as Bash and change your working directory to the 'CEHYL' directory (e.g. `cd CEHYL`)
1. Execute the command `npm install`. This wil install all the required dependencies in the local node_modules directory (which our application will utilize).
1. Run the application on either an emulator or physical device using one of the following commands:
   1. `npx react-native run-android` for android
   1. `npx react-native run-ios` for iOS.
